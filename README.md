This library support loading environment variables from a `.env` file and reading them like what `.json` does but more simply!

### üìù About this repository
- This project is owned by [@harshfeudal](https://github.com/harshfeudal). You can join my Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/BAk2CXpRAT)!
- This library can be used for many different projects, currently, this library is enough to make a C++ Discord bot using [D++](https://dpp.dev/) for a safety token reader (you can use `.gitignore` to ignore `.env` file).

### üö® Usage
1. Download ONLY `dotenv` folder (make sure that it contains `dotenv.h` inside). Simple right?
2. Include it in your project like this:

`main.cpp`
```cpp
#include <dotenv/dotenv.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Load your .env file
	dotenv::load(".env");

    // Read your .env variable
    char* my_var;
    size_t envValueSize;
    _dupenv_s(&my_var, &envValueSize, "MY_VAR");

    // Read it
    std::cout << "The variable is: " << my_var << std::endl;

    // Remember to free it
    free(my_var);
}
```

* Some notice update: You can also use `std::getenv("YOUR_ENV_VAR")`.
However, some compiler like MSVC doesn't allow you to use that, and they recommend you to replace as `_dupenv_s`.
You can also use other methods if you find a new one! If you are not using MSVC, you can do like below (recommend):

```cpp
#include <dotenv/dotenv.h>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    // Load your .env file
	dotenv::load(".env");

    // Read your .env variable
    const char* my_var = std::getenv("MY_VAR");

    // Read it
    std::cout << "The variable is: " << my_var << std::endl;
}
```

... and compare it to your `.env` file:

`.env`

```env
MY_VAR="Hello World!"
```

Done! Simple right (I think)?

### ‚ú® Library features
1. Somehow you really want to skip a line (or do whatever you want) like this:
```console
The sentence is:
"Hello World"
    - Hello 2023 -
```

... so, with this library feature, to do this, you can just do this in your `.env` file:
```env
SENTENCE="\n\"Hello World\"\n\t- Hello 2023 -"
```

and it will work as expected!

2. Or, you really want to make a comment like this:
```env
TOKEN="WW91ckRpc2NvcmRCb3RUb2tlbg=="    # Your Discord bot token
```

With this library feature, your comment will be ignored after the `#` mark! Comments begin where a `#` exists, so if your value contains a `#` please wrap it in quotes.

3. This library just includes __only a header file (`dotenv.h`)__!

4. Very similar to what Javascript does; The expansion engine roughly has the following rules:

    - `$KEY` will expand any env with the name `KEY`
    - `${KEY}` will expand any env with the name `KEY`
    - `\$KEY` will escape the `$KEY` rather than expand
    - `${KEY:-default}` will first attempt to expand any env with the name `KEY`. If not one, then it will return default

5. If you decide to make an empty variable like this:
```env
EMPTY=
```

... so remember to have a space like this:
```env
EMPTY= # A space after the '=' symbol
```
